# TRACING-RUMOURS-BY-ANALYZING-SOCIAL-MEDIA-DATA
Social media generates huge amount of metadata that could be used to understand social information flow, identify how spreading happens, etc. Many kinds of such metadata could
be represented as temporal networks, networks that record when contacts happen, in addition to who has been in contact with whom. The field of temporal networks is still under
rapid development. There are a number of techniques to analyse social media data sets. These methods serve to identify important spreaders, characterize the behaviour of the
social media users, and map out temporal ad topological structures. In our project, we will construct a temporal network using social media metadata and find the influential and important spreaders. Influential spreader is the one who can influence many others.Important spreaders are the ones who play a vital role in boosting the spreading process
